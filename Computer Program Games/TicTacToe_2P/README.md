# About the code 

 The code is a Python implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using the Pygame library. It allows two players to play the game on a graphical interface.

# Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries: The code starts by importing the required libraries, including `pygame`, `math`, and `time`.

2. Initialize Pygame: The Pygame library is initialized using `pygame.init()`.

3. Set up the game window: The code sets up the game window with a specified width and caption using the `pygame.display.set_mode()` and `pygame.display.set_caption()` functions.

4. Define color variables: Several color variables are defined using RGB values.

5. Load and display images: The code loads and displays images on the game window using the `pygame.image.load()` and `pygame.transform.scale()` functions. The images include the tic-tac-toe board, X, and O symbols.

6. Define font for end messages: The code defines a font for displaying end messages.

7. Draw grid and initialize game array: The `draw_grid()` function is defined to draw the tic-tac-toe grid on the game window. The `initialize_grid()` function initializes the game array, which represents the state of the game board, with empty cells.

8. Handle mouse click events: The `click()` function handles mouse click events. It checks the position of the mouse click and determines the corresponding cell on the game board. If the cell is empty, it updates the game array and the current player's turn.

9. Check for a win: The `has_won()` function checks if a player has won the game by examining the game array. It checks for winning combinations in rows, columns, and diagonals.

10. Check for a draw: The `has_drawn()` function checks if the game has resulted in a draw by examining the game array. If all cells are filled and no player has won, it is considered a draw.

11. Display end messages: The `display_mess()` function displays end messages on the game window. It is called when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

12. Render the game: The `render()` function updates the game window by filling it with the background color, drawing the grid, and rendering the X and O symbols on the board.

13. Main game loop: The `main()` function contains the main game loop. It handles events, calls the `click()` function, renders the game, and checks for a win or draw condition. The loop continues until a win or draw occurs.

14. Execute the game: The game is executed by calling the `main()` function within an infinite loop.

# Please note that the code assumes the existence of image files (`tictactoe.png`, `x1.2.png`, and `o.png`) in a directory named "image" relative to the code file.
