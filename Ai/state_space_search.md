# STATE SPACE TREE ALGORITHM

->One common algorithm for state space search is the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all the neighboring states ->of a given state before moving on to the next level of states. Here's an example of how the BFS algorithm works:

# EXAMPLE :
->Let's consider a simple problem of finding a path from a starting point to a goal point on a grid. The grid has obstacles, and you ->can only move up, down, left, or right.

# Define the problem:
# THEM FIRST
State: Each state represents a point on the grid.
Initial state: The starting point.
Goal state: The desired destination.
Actions: Moving up, down, left, or right.
Transition model: Determines the result of taking an action in a given state.
Goal test: Checks if the current state is the goal state.
Path cost: The cost associated with each step.
Implement the BFS algorithm:

# SECOND
Create a queue to store states.
Enqueue the initial state into the queue.
Create a set to store visited states.
Add the initial state to the set of visited states.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a state from the queue.
If the state is the goal state, return the path.
Generate all possible neighboring states from the current state.
For each neighbor:
If it is not in the set of visited states:
Add it to the set of visited states.
Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.
Example:
Let's say we have a 4x4 grid:
Start: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)
Obstacles: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)

# Using BFS, the algorithm would explore the states in the following order:

Level 1: (1, 1)
Level 2: (2, 1), (1, 2)
Level 3: (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3)
Level 4: (4, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3)
Level 5: (3, 3), (4, 2), (2, 4)
Level 6: (4, 3), (3, 4)
Level 7: (4, 4)
The algorithm would return the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4)

# CONCLUSION 
BFS guarantees that it will find the shortest path if one exists, but it may require a lot of memory if the state space is large.
