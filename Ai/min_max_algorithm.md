# Below is a simplified implementation of the Min-Max algorithm in Python:

def min_max(board, depth, maximizing_player):
    # Base case: check if the game is over or depth limit reached
    if game_over(board) or depth == 0:
        return evaluate(board)
    
    if maximizing_player:
        max_eval = float('-inf')
        for move in get_possible_moves(board):
            new_board = make_move(board, move)
            eval = min_max(new_board, depth - 1, False)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
        return max_eval
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for move in get_possible_moves(board):
            new_board = make_move(board, move)
            eval = min_max(new_board, depth - 1, True)
            min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
        return min_eval

# CODE EXPLANATION :

->In this code, the min_max function takes three parameters: board, depth, and maximizing_player. The board represents the current ->state of the game, depth specifies the maximum depth to explore in the game tree, and maximizing_player indicates whether it's the ->turn of the maximizing player or not.

->The function recursively evaluates each possible move by alternating between maximizing and minimizing players. It uses a utility ->function, evaluate, to assign scores to terminal states. The get_possible_moves function retrieves all the valid moves for a given ->board state, and make_move function applies a move to the board.

->The algorithm starts with the maximizing player and iterates through all possible moves. For each move, it generates a new board ->state and recursively calls min_max with a decreased depth and the opposite value for maximizing_player. The best score (maximum ->or minimum) is stored and returned at each level.

->Keep in mind that this is a simplified implementation, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific game and game rules by ->implementing the game_over, evaluate, get_possible_moves, and make_move functions accordingly.
