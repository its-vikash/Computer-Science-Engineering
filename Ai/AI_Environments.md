# MOST COMMENLY KNOWN AI ENVIRONMENTS

 In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), there are various types of environments that serve as settings for AI agents to operate and learn. These environments can be classified into four main categories: fully observable, partially observable, deterministic, and stochastic. Each type of environment presents unique challenges and characteristics that influence how AI agents perceive and interact with their surroundings.

# Fully Observable Deterministic Environment:

In a fully observable deterministic environment, an AI agent has complete knowledge of the current state and can accurately predict the outcome of its actions. These environments are predictable and have no randomness or uncertainty. An example of such an environment is a game of chess. The AI agent can observe the entire chessboard and know the state of all the pieces. It can evaluate all possible moves and their consequences, allowing it to make optimal decisions.

# Partially Observable Deterministic Environment:

In a partially observable deterministic environment, an AI agent has limited or incomplete information about the current state. However, the environment itself is still deterministic, meaning that the outcomes of actions are predictable. A classic example is the game of Poker. The AI agent does not have access to the opponents' cards, which makes the state of the game partially observable. Despite the limited information, the agent can still apply strategies and make decisions based on the observed actions and probabilities.

# Fully Observable Stochastic Environment:

In a fully observable stochastic environment, an AI agent has complete knowledge of the current state, but the environment introduces randomness or uncertainty into the outcomes of actions. An example of this type of environment is a weather prediction system. The agent can observe the current weather conditions and apply mathematical models to forecast the future. However, due to the inherent unpredictability of weather patterns, the predictions will have some degree of uncertainty.

# Partially Observable Stochastic Environment:

In a partially observable stochastic environment, both incomplete information and randomness exist. This type of environment poses significant challenges for AI agents. An example is autonomous driving. The agent must make decisions based on the limited information available from sensors (such as cameras and lidar) and account for the uncertainty and unpredictability of other vehicles, pedestrians, and road conditions.

It's worth noting that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and real-world environments often exhibit a combination of characteristics. AI researchers and engineers strive to develop algorithms and techniques that can handle the complexities of different environments, allowing AI agents to adapt, learn, and make informed decisions based on the available information.

# SUMMARY

In summary,the types of environments in AI can be classified based on observability (fully or partially observable) and determinism (deterministic or stochastic). Each type presents unique challenges and opportunities for AI agents, requiring the development of specialized algorithms and approaches to effectively navigate and interact with their surroundings.
